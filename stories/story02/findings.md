## Analysis Results

### 1. Measuring the |0⟩ State

- **Quantum Circuit:**
  - `qc_0` is a quantum circuit with 1 qubit and 1 classical bit.
  - The qubit is measured, and the result is stored in the classical bit.
  - The circuit is compiled and simulated with 1024 shots to obtain the results.
  - **Result:** The |0⟩ state is measured as 0 in most of the 1024 shots.

### 2. Measuring the |1⟩ State

- **Quantum Circuit:**
  - `qc_1` is a quantum circuit with 1 qubit and 1 classical bit.
  - An X gate is applied to flip the qubit state from |0⟩ to |1⟩.
  - The qubit is measured, and the result is stored in the classical bit.
  - The circuit is compiled and simulated with 1024 shots to obtain the results.
  - **Result:** The |1⟩ state is measured as 1 in most of the 1024 shots.

### Code Explanation

1. **State Measurement Function (`measure_state`):**
   - Compiles the given quantum circuit and runs the simulation to return the measurement results.
   - The `shots` parameter specifies the number of simulation shots.

2. **Distribution Visualization Function (`plot_measurement_distribution`):**
   - Generates and visualizes a histogram of the given measurement results.
   - The `title` parameter specifies the title of the histogram.

3. **Visualization Script Creation Function (`create_visualization_script`):**
   - Measures the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states, outputs the measurement results, and generates histograms.
   - Measures `qc_0` and `qc_1` circuits and visualizes the results.

### Findings

1. **|0⟩ State Measurement Results:**
   - The |0⟩ state is predominantly measured as 0. This confirms that the initial state is |0⟩.
   - Example: `{'0': 1024}`.

2. **|1⟩ State Measurement Results:**
   - After applying the X gate, the |1⟩ state is predominantly measured as 1. This confirms the successful state transition.
   - Example: `{'1': 1024}`.

### Conclusion

The provided code successfully creates a script that measures the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states of a quantum circuit and visualizes the measurement distributions. The simulation results show consistent measurements for both states, demonstrating the reliability of quantum state measurements. The code and script fulfill the requirement of generating plots showing measurement distributions.
